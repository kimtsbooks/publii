Not just toys — he gets sad when we throw out random stuff like old puzzle mats or even a plastic screw that once fell down the toilet. 😅 I think he’s attached to the memories.</p>\n<p>So I validate the feelings, but I also gently remind him that it’s not healthy to get too attached to material things. People, relationships, and memories are what matter most.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, I sorted through a lot of his old toys for donation and braced myself for big feelings. I prepared him ahead of time and explained my reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The attic needs to be cleared (because the ceiling might crash down… 😬)</li>\n<li>He doesn’t play with these toys anymore</li>\n<li>The kids who receive them will be so happy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I told him I could easily give the toys away and he might not even notice — but I promised I wouldn’t do that. Instead, I wanted him to be part of the process. He could choose five toys he really wanted to keep, and we did that together.</p>\n<p>Even after that, he still felt sad and kept whining about it — which, if I’m being honest, is very triggering for me. But I’m glad I paused and tried to see it from his perspective.</p>\n<p><em>“It’s hard to let go of toys, huh? I understand. It’s hard for me too sometimes. But we can do hard things. Sometimes we need to do them even if we don’t want to. The families who receive these toys will be so happy and grateful. Thank you — I’m so proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself too.”</em></p>\n<p>He let a few tears out… and then he was okay. ❤️</p>\n<p>Have you had similar moments with your child?

            "content_html": "<h2>Mom Guilt</h2>\n<p>I stopped blogging for a while because I was afraid that maybe I was sharing too much. Most people only show the best parts of their lives online — and here I was writing about some of Kyle’s most vulnerable moments.</p>\n<p>I felt guilty, wondering if I was making him seem like a difficult or angry child. In truth, he is one of the sweetest boys I know — thoughtful, smart, funny, and kind. I shared our struggles not to label him, but in the hope that it might help other parents feel less alone.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img  src=\"https://kimtsbooks.com/media/posts/14/KimTS-and-Kyle-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"819\"></figure>\n<p>As parents, we all have strong opinions about how children should be raised. It’s easy to judge through our own lens and forget that every child, family, and situation is different. I’m guilty of this too, and I’m learning to be more intentional.</p>\n<p>I know that sharing pieces of our life opens us up to judgment. But I choose to keep sharing, because we grow when we learn from one another. What matters most isn’t what everyone else thinks — it’s what we believe, and how we show up for the people we love.</p>\n<h2>Overcoming Anger</h2>\n<p>I’ve shared many stories about Kyle’s anger because it’s been our biggest struggle — and the very reason I started writing books about big feelings. Emotions rise and fall, but I’m incredibly proud of how far we’ve come.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, I asked Kyle to do something he didn’t want to do. I could feel the anger building. His dad chimed in — which I knew would only make things harder.</p>\n<p><strong>Me:</strong> “Take deep breaths. I know you’re upset, but don’t let anger control you.”</p>\n<p><strong>Kyle:</strong> “I can’t! It’s too strong!”</p>\n<p><strong>Me:</strong> “You’re stronger than your anger. You know what to do.”</p>\n<p>Things were about to escalate when he suddenly said:</p>\n<p><strong>“Mom! Help! Get me a pen and paper!”</strong></p>\n<p>So I did.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"https://kimtsbooks.com/media/posts/14/Kyles-Rules-of-Anger-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\">\n<figcaption><strong>Rules of My Anger (Kyle, age 6)</strong><br>1. If you try to make me calm down, my anger will stop me.<br>2. The longer we wait, the angrier I get.<br>3. I can’t write anymore.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Finding His Own Way</h2>\n<p>As he wrote, I watched the anger slowly fade. He filled three pages before finally calming down.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"https://kimtsbooks.com/media/posts/14/Kyles-Rules-of-Anger-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"726\" height=\"1024\"></figure>\n<p><strong>What Helps When I’m Angry (written by Kyle)</strong><br>1. Dad’s voice sometimes makes me more angry.<br>2. When someone talks to me, I get more angry.<br>3. Be more gentle with me.<br>4. Blow on me like the Big Bad Wolf or Mr. Wolf.<br>5. Sing or play a song.<br>6. Punch beds.<br>7. Run crazy like Sonic.<br>8. Use pain — <strong>danger ✗ do not use</strong>.<br>9. Annoy me a bit — <strong>danger ✗ do not use</strong>.<br>10. Draw.<br>11. Rip paper.<br>12. Kiss me.<br>13. Making me calm down makes it harder for me to calm down.</p>\n<p><em>Reading this felt like being handed a map into his inner world.</em></p>\n<p>I felt such pride watching him put his feelings into words. He remembered the tools we’d talked about over the years — and even discovered new ones on his own.</p>\n<p>It felt like a quiet reassurance: <em>You’re doing okay.</em></p>\n<p>Gentle parenting isn’t perfect. I still talk too much. I still tell him to calm down when I shouldn’t. But moments like this remind me that the work matters.</p>\n<p>I’ve kept those pages safe. Maybe I’ll laminate them and bring them out the next time emotions run high. We’ve gone two months without a major episode — not a guarantee, but a gift.</p>\n<p>Thanks for being here and walking this journey with us.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>If stories like this resonate with you, you’re not alone.

My gentle prodding wasn’t working, and he was starting to miss the activity.</p>\n<p>So I brought out my Momster voice.</p>\n<p><strong>“DO IT.”</strong><br>Then I started counting: <strong>“Three… two… one…”</strong>—which he absolutely hates.</p>\n<p>Full-on drama ensued.</p>\n<p><strong>“I WISH YOU WEREN’T MY MOM!”</strong></p>\n<p>“I will always be your mom.”</p>\n<p><strong>“I HATE YOU!”</strong></p>\n<p>“Even if you hate me, I will love you forever. I know you don’t want to do this, but you need to learn to sit properly and do your work. Finish this first, and then we’ll talk about our feelings, okay?”</p>\n<p>I handed him the pencil and notebook. He started writing, tears streaming down his face. He kept muttering, “I hate you,” while I kept replying, “I love you,” until he finally finished.</p>\n<p>“I’m proud of you for finishing your work,” I said. “I know you didn’t want to do it, but you did what needed to be done. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>“I’m still angry at you! I hate you!”</p>\n<p>“It’s okay to feel angry,” I replied. “But it’s not okay to say hurtful things. I will love you no matter what you say or do. Still, words matter. It’s okay to tell me you’re angry at me or that you don’t like me. But hate is a very strong word, and it hurts too much. I’m just protecting my heart — so think carefully before you say it again.”</p>\n<p>“I’m angry at you, and I don’t like you.”</p>\n<p>“That’s okay,” I said. “I’ll give you some time.”</p>\n<p>We talked about other things to help him cool down. Whenever I managed to make him laugh, he would stop himself and frown again.</p>\n<p><strong>“I’m angry. I want to stay angry. I’m trying my best to stay angry!”</strong></p>\n<p>“It’s normal to feel angry,” I told him. “But staying angry for too long can hurt your heart and make you feel weak. Anyone can be angry, but not everyone can overcome it. Learning to let go of anger makes you stronger. We’ve talked about different ways to do that — now you need to try them and find what works for you.”</p>\n<p>It took a while, but eventually, he softened.</p>\n<p><strong>“Mom… I think I love you again.”</strong></p>\n<p>“I’m glad,” I said. “But I never stopped loving you. I’m so proud of you for being stronger than your anger.”</p>\n<p>“Me too. I’m sorry for getting so angry and for saying those things.”</p>\n<p>“It’s okay,” I replied. “Just try not to say them again.”</p>\n<p>And then we hugged.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading. I honestly don’t know if I’m always doing the right thing. I’m far from perfect and definitely not an expert — just a mom sharing her journey, hoping it might help someone else who’s struggling too.</p>\n<p>What I do know is that a few months ago, I might have lashed out in anger myself — partly from the shame of feeling like I had the only child in class who kept having tantrums. I’m learning to remind myself that my child’s behavior is not always a reflection of my parenting. What matters more is how I respond.</p>\n<p>All kids are different. They grow and learn at their own pace. So we do our best to stay patient, trust our instincts, and adapt. There will always be people who disagree with how we parent — but just as every child is different, so is every family, situation, and culture.</p>\n<p>We’re not perfect. But we keep trying, learning, and moving forward — because our little ones are counting on us. ❤️</p>\n<div class=\"soft-divider\"> </div>\n<p><em>If moments like this feel familiar, our stories are written with families like yours in mind.

Like many parents, my first instinct was to reassure him—to remind him that it wasn’t real, that he was safe, and that it was only a dream. But as the days passed and pieces of the dream slowly surfaced, I realized that what he needed most wasn’t for the fear to be dismissed, but for it to be gently understood.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img src=\"https://kimtsbooks.com/media/posts/16/How-I-Helped-My-Child-Make-His-Nightmare-Less-Scary.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<div class=\"soft-divider\"> </div>\n<p>One night, as I was tucking him in, he looked at me and asked,</p>\n<p><em>“Do you remember the scary dream I had?”</em></p>\n<p>“The one with the wizard?” I asked.</p>\n<p>He nodded. “It was really scary…”</p>\n<p>I gently asked, “Do you want to talk about it — and maybe try to make it a little less scary?”</p>\n<p>His eyes lit up. “Okay! What if the wizard was like Magic Koopa from Mario?”</p>\n<p>We laughed. We made the wizard dance. We made him silly. For a moment, the fear loosened its grip.</p>\n<p>Then Kyle grew quiet again.</p>\n<p>“There’s more I didn’t tell you, Mom… because it was too scary.”</p>\n<p>He told me about an old man trapped inside a helmet. A duck. Pins and needles. And how the duck died.</p>\n<p>I could hear how heavy this had been sitting in his little body.</p>\n<p>“That is a very sad dream,” I said. “Do you want to try changing it — just a little — so it doesn’t feel so scary anymore?”</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>So together, we changed the story.</p>\n<p>The wizard became a <strong>good wizard</strong>. The needles became <strong>magic needles that stopped the pain</strong>. The duck was old and tired, and ready to rest.</p>\n<p>The duck’s family was waiting for him. The old man was sad — but he understood. And the duck died peacefully, surrounded by love.</p>\n<p>When we finished, Kyle looked at me and said,</p>\n<p><em>“That’s a nice story, Mom.”</em></p>\n<p>“Do you feel better now?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Thanks, Mommy.”</p>\n<p>We hugged for a long time. Just before drifting off to sleep, he lifted his head one last time.</p>\n<p>“Mom… did you enjoy talking about my dream and making it nicer?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” I said. “Very much.”</p>\n<p>“Me too.”</p>\n<p>And then — finally — he fell asleep.</p>\n<p>❤️</p>\n<div class=\"soft-divider\"> </div>\n<p>Moments like this are why I write books about big feelings.

If you’re doing something wrong—like not trying your best—I will push you to do better. Even if you don’t like me right then, that’s okay.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"2723\" data-end=\"2991\">I continued, “What matters most to me is that you grow into the best person you can be. You told me you feel most loved when Mommy and Daddy tell you we love you, right? So even when it doesn’t <em data-start=\"2917\" data-end=\"2923\">feel</em> like it, I want you to believe what I say: Mommy always loves you.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"2993\" data-end=\"3035\">“Okay, Mom,” he said. “I feel better now.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"3037\" data-end=\"3119\">He stayed after class with his teacher to finish the test. Later, we talked again.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3121\" data-end=\"3378\">“I’m sorry for getting angry,” I told him. “It’s not so important to me that you get all the answers right. What matters more is that you try your best. If you try and still get a lot wrong, that’s okay. I’ll help you fix it so you can do better next time.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"3380\" data-end=\"3430\">I paused, then asked, “Were you trying your best?”</p>\n<p data-start=\"3432\" data-end=\"3466\">“No, Mom. I was being a bit lazy.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"3468\" data-end=\"3540\">“It’s good that you know,” I said. “Because knowing is half the battle.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"3542\" data-end=\"3573\">“So what’s the rest?” he asked.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3575\" data-end=\"3587\">“Fixing it.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"3589\" data-end=\"3638\">He smiled. “So it’s K = Know, F = Fix. What’s C?”</p>\n<p data-start=\"3640\" data-end=\"3685\">I thought for a moment. “How about… conquer?”</p>\n<p data-start=\"3687\" data-end=\"3721\">His eyes lit up. “Okay! K… F… C!!”</p>\n<p>🤣</p>\n<div class=\"soft-divider\"> </div>\n<p data-start=\"3751\" data-end=\"3953\">Moments like this remind me that love doesn’t always look soft. Sometimes it looks like patience. Sometimes it looks like repair. And sometimes, it looks like pushing—<em data-start=\"3918\" data-end=\"3953\">and then coming back to reassure.</em></p>\n<p data-start=\"3955\" data-end=\"4140\">That’s why I write books about big feelings. Not to erase frustration, fear, or resistance—but to help children feel safe enough to talk about them, and supported enough to keep trying.</p>\n<p data-start=\"4142\" data-end=\"4329\">If this story resonated with you, you may find our books helpful as gentle tools for navigating fear, worry, frustration, and other big emotions—at home, in the classroom, or in practice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/learn-more#get-the-books\">Get the books</a> · <a href=\"/blog\">Read more blog posts</a></p>\n<p data-start=\"4377\" data-end=\"4453\">💙 If this helped you, feel free to share it with someone who might need it.</p>",

Every time I asked him to come eat, he answered with a protesting grunt and hugged his furry dinosaur even tighter.</p>\n<p><strong>“What’s wrong, Kyle? What happened?”</strong><br><em>grunt</em></p>\n<p>I could hear him crying, so instead of pushing him to talk, I tried something that often works for us—distraction first, conversation later.</p>\n<p>“Kyle, do you want to get some toys from the attic?<br>Do you want to hear a funny story?<br>May I order one hug, please?”</p>\n<p>Nothing worked.</p>\n<p>So I tried reading him a few lines from the next book I’m working on, <em>Feeling All My Anger</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Look for a hug, just hug someone — your mommy or your daddy<br>Your favorite toy, your favorite blankie — or maybe hug your nanny!</p>\n<p>Imagine that the hug’s so strong, it drowns out all the flames<br>A hug that’s from someone you love, accepts and never blames…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He grunted after every line, but I could feel his body slowly relaxing. I carried him in my arms and hugged him tight as I read. Almost there — but not quite.</p>\n<p>“Kyle, what was that game you were asking me about earlier? The one you wanted me to check? Should we Google it together?”</p>\n<p>“Sega Genesis,” he nodded, wiping the tears from his eyes.</p>\n<p>We searched for it on my phone, and just like that, he started talking normally again.</p>\n<p>“What happened, Kyle? Why were you upset?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, Mom. I don’t remember.”</p>\n<p>“That’s okay. Should we eat now?”</p>\n<p>“Okay.”</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, he looked at me seriously.</p>\n<p><strong>“Mom, I want to tell you something… but I’m scared.”</strong></p>\n<p>“You never have to be scared of me, Kyle. You can tell me anything.”</p>\n<p>“Okay. Let me tell you through a book.”</p>\n<p>He walked over to his book cabinet and pulled out his favorite book at the moment — <em>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em>. He showed me the back cover and pointed to one line:</p>\n<p><strong>“Being a kid can really stink.”</strong></p>\n<p>Ohhhh.</p>\n<p>“I understand,” I said. “It’s not nice to always be bossed around, huh? You didn’t want to eat yet, but we kept reminding you?”</p>\n<p>He smiled and nodded.</p>\n<p>“You know what’s really cool?” I told him. “Mommy and Daddy were kids once too. We know how it feels. And I love that you told me how you felt using a book.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, me too!”</p>\n<p>“But you know what? It’s also pretty fun being a kid. Last Christmas, did Mommy and Daddy get any toys?”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“And how many toys did you get?”</p>\n<p>“So many!”</p>\n<p>“Well… you got toys when <em>you</em> were a kid,” he countered.</p>\n<p>“That’s true,” I laughed. “That’s why being a kid is pretty great.”</p>\n<p>He ran over to his dad and showed him the same line in the book.</p>\n<p>His dad took a serious tone and started counting on his fingers:<br>“You have food, your own room, toys, video games — not all kids have those.”</p>\n<p>Kyle immediately copied him and counted on his fingers too:<br>“Other kids have food, and rooms, and toys…”</p>\n<p>“Not all kids,” his dad said. “Especially here.”</p>\n<p>“I’m talking about the kids in America!”</p>\n<p>“No, a lot of kids there don’t have those either.”</p>\n<p>“Well… I’m talking about the billionaires.”</p>\n<p>We all burst out laughing and finally enjoyed our lunch.</p>\n<p>Later that day, Kyle announced,<br><strong>“I’m adding this to my worst days list.”</strong></p>\n<p>“Huh? Why? I thought we had a good day after you calmed down.”</p>\n<p>“Well… I guess it’s okay. So it’s an okay day.”</p>\n<p>“Okay days are good,” I said.</p>\n<p><strong>Wishing everyone more okay days. 😊</strong></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://kimtsbooks.com/learn-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sometimes kids don’t have the words yet — but stories can help them find them.</a></em></p>",

They require children to slow down, break things apart, and explain their thinking step by step—something that can feel frustrating even for kids who already understand the concept.</p>\n<p>When Kyle gets frustrated during class, it usually shows up as silliness, tantrums, or a complete refusal to work. Yesterday, he put his head down on the table and started grunting and growling.</p>\n<p>After I calmed him down, the silliness continued. He wouldn’t answer the seatwork, and I could feel my own patience thinning.</p>\n<p>Then I tried something different.</p>\n<p>“Do you find it hard,” I asked, “or are you bored?”</p>\n<p><em>“A little bit of both.”</em></p>\n<p>Before school started again this week, we told him that if he did well in class and was well-behaved at home, he could earn a prize — but only if he worked hard for it.</p>\n<p>His enthusiasm lasted about a week.</p>\n<p>So I reminded him: “You remember how you said you wanted to work for a PS4 or PS5? Of course it’s going to be hard. If it were easy, the prize wouldn’t feel as special.</p>\n<p>You have to study anyway — so it’s either you study hard and work toward the prize, or you study half-heartedly and don’t. You might as well work for it, right?”</p>\n<p>Then I added,</p>\n<p>“Do you know how hard it was for me to give birth to you? It was really hard — and very painful. But it was all worth it, because you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.”</p>\n<p>He smiled.</p>\n<p>We hugged.</p>\n<p>And then he went back to his desk and finished his math work — calmly and diligently.</p>\n<p>“I’m so proud of you, Kyle,” I said. “I knew you could do it if you just focused.”</p>\n<p><em>“Yeah, Mom.

Adults talked; children listened—or were told they were “too young” to understand.</p>\n<p>I remember how disempowering that felt. So when Kyle started getting curious about adult conversations, I decided to try something different.</p>\n<p>Instead of shutting him out, I began explaining complex ideas in ways he could understand—not to tell him what to think, but to help him learn <em>how</em> to think.</p>\n<div class=\"soft-divider\"> </div>\n<h2>Truth vs. Opinion</h2>\n<p>One evening, we talked about the difference between facts and opinions.</p>\n<p>Facts are things we can prove with evidence. Opinions are how we feel about those facts.</p>\n<p>Kyle immediately jumped in:</p>\n<p><em>“Like—fun fact: dinosaurs existed!”</em></p>\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n<p>But saying someone is cute, funny, or scary? Those are opinions — and different people can feel differently.</p>\n<p>Understanding that difference helps kids make sense of the world, especially in a time when they hear so many voices and ideas.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Fairness, Courage, and Doing What’s Right</h2>\n<p>We also talked about people who stand up for what is right, even when it’s difficult or dangerous.</p>\n<p>I explained that some adults choose honesty and courage — telling the truth, protecting others, and standing up to bullies — even when it would be easier to stay quiet.</p>\n<p>Kyle listened carefully, then said:</p>\n<p><em>“So… being brave means doing good, even when it’s hard?”</em></p>\n<p>Yes. Exactly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Respect, Equality, and Kindness</h2>\n<p>That naturally led to a conversation about respect — being mindful of our words, our actions, and how they affect others.</p>\n<p>We talked about being gentle with people who may be smaller, younger, or more vulnerable. About using strength to protect, not to harm.</p>\n<p>And about kindness — especially when we’re feeling silly, angry, or frustrated.</p>\n<p>He thought about it quietly, then promised:</p>\n<p><em>“I’ll try to be kind and respectful.”</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>That’s all I can really hope for—not perfection, but awareness.</p>\n<p>Children don’t need to understand everything right away. But they <em>can</em> understand values. They <em>can</em> learn empathy. And they <em>can</em> learn how to ask questions and think critically.</p>\n<p>Our children are growing up in a complex world. Starting these conversations early helps them navigate it with confidence and compassion.</p>\n<p><em> Believe there is good in the world.

He had adjusted well to online preschool, so I expected more of the same.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1156\" data-end=\"1168\">I was wrong.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1170\" data-end=\"1447\">Sitting through two and a half hours of structured learning was hard—especially when he already knew most of the lessons. The Zoom chat box was a constant distraction. The rocking chair banged against the floor, scratching our parquet tiles and slowly wearing down my patience.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1449\" data-end=\"1478\">One day, everything piled up.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1480\" data-end=\"1643\">I was stressed about meals, about training a new cook, about the house. I felt watched and judged for things that didn’t really matter—but felt heavy all the same.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1645\" data-end=\"1722\">When Kyle minimized the Zoom window to Google things during class, I snapped.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1724\" data-end=\"1824\">He came over to me, growling, trying to release his frustration. He hugged me—but I was still upset.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1826\" data-end=\"1887\">Then, in a split second, he lashed out and hit me in the eye.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1889\" data-end=\"1967\">It hurt. I screamed. And in shock, I reacted in a way I never thought I would.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1969\" data-end=\"1983\">I spanked him.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1985\" data-end=\"2080\">Almost immediately, the contradiction hit me: <em data-start=\"2031\" data-end=\"2080\">How does hitting a child teach them not to hit?</em></p>\n<p data-start=\"2082\" data-end=\"2185\">But in that moment, all I wanted was for him to understand how much it hurt—so he wouldn’t do it again.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2187\" data-end=\"2305\">Afterward, I sat alone, angry and ashamed, wondering if everything I believed about positive parenting had been naive.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2307\" data-end=\"2403\">Later, Kyle came to me. He apologized. We talked. We processed what happened—like we usually do.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2405\" data-end=\"2436\">Still, the self-doubt lingered.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2438\" data-end=\"2629\">Eventually, I realized something important: the problem wasn’t my parenting philosophy. It was my internal pressure—my expectations, my unresolved beliefs, and the quiet fear of being judged.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2631\" data-end=\"2727\">Children aren’t meant to sit still for long hours. Restlessness isn’t misbehavior. It’s biology.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2729\" data-end=\"2844\">What I was really struggling with was the belief that my child’s behavior was a reflection of my worth as a parent.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2846\" data-end=\"2900\">What an unbearable burden to place on a five-year-old.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2902\" data-end=\"3006\">There is no room for shame in parenting.
