Between the ages of three and six, we went through a particularly challenging season — one filled with big emotions, big reactions, and moments that felt overwhelming for both of us.</p><p data-start="724" data-end="1083">Like many families, we struggled with managing feelings like anger, fear, worry, grief, and shyness. Sometimes even the smallest moments could lead to the biggest emotional outbursts. Through those experiences, I began creating books that offered simple, reassuring language to help children feel seen — and to give adults clear, gentle words to support them.</p><p data-start="1085" data-end="1400">While these books were born from our personal experience at home, they’ve also been thoughtfully created to support emotional learning in classrooms, counseling spaces, and therapeutic settings. They encourage adults to sit with children through difficult emotions, helping kids learn that feelings are safe, temporary, and manageable. The language is simple, developmentally appropriate, and designed to open conversations rather than provide quick fixes. </p><p data-start="1402" data-end="1547">If any part of this sounds familiar, I hope our books can gently support you and the children in your care as you navigate big feelings together.</p><p>You can read more about our journey <a href="https://kimtsbooks.com/blog/">on the blog</a>.
