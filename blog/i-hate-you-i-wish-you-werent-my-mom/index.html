My gentle prodding wasn’t working, and he was starting to miss the activity.</p><p>So I brought out my Momster voice.</p><p><strong>“DO IT.”</strong><br>Then I started counting: <strong>“Three… two… one…”</strong>—which he absolutely hates.</p><p>Full-on drama ensued.</p><p><strong>“I WISH YOU WEREN’T MY MOM!”</strong></p><p>“I will always be your mom.”</p><p><strong>“I HATE YOU!”</strong></p><p>“Even if you hate me, I will love you forever. I know you don’t want to do this, but you need to learn to sit properly and do your work. Finish this first, and then we’ll talk about our feelings, okay?”</p><p>I handed him the pencil and notebook. He started writing, tears streaming down his face. He kept muttering, “I hate you,” while I kept replying, “I love you,” until he finally finished.</p><p>“I’m proud of you for finishing your work,” I said. “I know you didn’t want to do it, but you did what needed to be done. Thank you.”</p><p>“I’m still angry at you! I hate you!”</p><p>“It’s okay to feel angry,” I replied. “But it’s not okay to say hurtful things. I will love you no matter what you say or do. Still, words matter. It’s okay to tell me you’re angry at me or that you don’t like me. But hate is a very strong word, and it hurts too much. I’m just protecting my heart — so think carefully before you say it again.”</p><p>“I’m angry at you, and I don’t like you.”</p><p>“That’s okay,” I said. “I’ll give you some time.”</p><p>We talked about other things to help him cool down. Whenever I managed to make him laugh, he would stop himself and frown again.</p><p><strong>“I’m angry. I want to stay angry. I’m trying my best to stay angry!”</strong></p><p>“It’s normal to feel angry,” I told him. “But staying angry for too long can hurt your heart and make you feel weak. Anyone can be angry, but not everyone can overcome it. Learning to let go of anger makes you stronger. We’ve talked about different ways to do that — now you need to try them and find what works for you.”</p><p>It took a while, but eventually, he softened.</p><p><strong>“Mom… I think I love you again.”</strong></p><p>“I’m glad,” I said. “But I never stopped loving you. I’m so proud of you for being stronger than your anger.”</p><p>“Me too. I’m sorry for getting so angry and for saying those things.”</p><p>“It’s okay,” I replied. “Just try not to say them again.”</p><p>And then we hugged.</p><p>Thank you for reading. I honestly don’t know if I’m always doing the right thing. I’m far from perfect and definitely not an expert — just a mom sharing her journey, hoping it might help someone else who’s struggling too.</p><p>What I do know is that a few months ago, I might have lashed out in anger myself — partly from the shame of feeling like I had the only child in class who kept having tantrums. I’m learning to remind myself that my child’s behavior is not always a reflection of my parenting. What matters more is how I respond.</p><p>All kids are different. They grow and learn at their own pace. So we do our best to stay patient, trust our instincts, and adapt. There will always be people who disagree with how we parent — but just as every child is different, so is every family, situation, and culture.</p><p>We’re not perfect. But we keep trying, learning, and moving forward — because our little ones are counting on us. ❤️</p><div class="soft-divider"> </div><p><em>If moments like this feel familiar, our stories are written with families like yours in mind.
