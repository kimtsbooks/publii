It's important to remember these feelings are normal and real.”<br><em>— Feeling All My Feelings, by Kim T. S.</em></blockquote><div class="soft-divider"> </div><h2>Hello Genius Books — Michael Dahl</h2><p>We fell in love with these books when Kyle was still a toddler. They’re simple, relatable, and perfect for very young children.</p><p><em>Little Monkey Calms Down</em> helped Kyle through several intense moments during his “terrible twos.”</p><p>Now that he’s older, he gravitates toward more challenging reads — but these books supported us through many early milestones. For that, we’ll always be grateful.</p><div class="soft-divider"> </div><h2>A Little SPOT Series — Diane Alber</h2><p>We discovered this series through Kindle Unlimited, and Kyle immediately wanted to download more.</p><p>We read several together before he moved on to other books, but the message and illustrations really stood out.</p><p>In our experience, this series may be better suited for slightly older kids, but the concepts are thoughtful and presented in a gentle, accessible way.</p><div class="soft-divider"> </div><h2>The Feelings Book &amp; The Goodbye Book — Todd Parr</h2><p>Kyle’s grandpa passed away when Kyle was three. A close friend sent us <em>The Goodbye Book</em>, and it brought us comfort during a very tender time.</p><p>Todd Parr has a gift for presenting big, difficult ideas with simplicity, warmth, and honesty — in a way children can truly understand.</p><div class="soft-divider"> </div><h2>Feeling All My Feelings — Kim T. S.</h2><p>Last—our own <em>Feeling All My Feelings</em> collection.</p><p>These books grew out of our experiences navigating big emotions at home. They’re written in rhyme, designed to be read together, and meant to help children name, accept, and move through their feelings—without judgment.</p><p>If you’re looking for books that support emotional awareness for both kids and adults, we hope you’ll find them helpful.</p><p><a href="/learn-more" target="null">Explore our books →</a></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 5, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kimtsbooks.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://kimtsbooks.com/authors/kim-t-s/" rel="author">Kim T.
