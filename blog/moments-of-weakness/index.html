Today, I want to share a moment of weakness.</p><p data-start="709" data-end="799">Life isn’t perfect. We all make mistakes. And sometimes, that’s exactly how growth begins.</p><div class="soft-divider"> </div><p><strong>July 13, 2021</strong></p><p data-start="854" data-end="990">I thought I finally had things figured out: as long as I stayed calm when Kyle had a tantrum, it wouldn’t escalate into full-blown rage.</p><p data-start="992" data-end="1154">When he started kindergarten online classes at “big school,” I assumed it would be easy. He had adjusted well to online preschool, so I expected more of the same.</p><p data-start="1156" data-end="1168">I was wrong.</p><p data-start="1170" data-end="1447">Sitting through two and a half hours of structured learning was hard—especially when he already knew most of the lessons. The Zoom chat box was a constant distraction. The rocking chair banged against the floor, scratching our parquet tiles and slowly wearing down my patience.</p><p data-start="1449" data-end="1478">One day, everything piled up.</p><p data-start="1480" data-end="1643">I was stressed about meals, about training a new cook, about the house. I felt watched and judged for things that didn’t really matter—but felt heavy all the same.</p><p data-start="1645" data-end="1722">When Kyle minimized the Zoom window to Google things during class, I snapped.</p><p data-start="1724" data-end="1824">He came over to me, growling, trying to release his frustration. He hugged me—but I was still upset.</p><p data-start="1826" data-end="1887">Then, in a split second, he lashed out and hit me in the eye.</p><p data-start="1889" data-end="1967">It hurt. I screamed. And in shock, I reacted in a way I never thought I would.</p><p data-start="1969" data-end="1983">I spanked him.</p><p data-start="1985" data-end="2080">Almost immediately, the contradiction hit me: <em data-start="2031" data-end="2080">How does hitting a child teach them not to hit?</em></p><p data-start="2082" data-end="2185">But in that moment, all I wanted was for him to understand how much it hurt—so he wouldn’t do it again.</p><p data-start="2187" data-end="2305">Afterward, I sat alone, angry and ashamed, wondering if everything I believed about positive parenting had been naive.</p><p data-start="2307" data-end="2403">Later, Kyle came to me. He apologized. We talked. We processed what happened—like we usually do.</p><p data-start="2405" data-end="2436">Still, the self-doubt lingered.</p><p data-start="2438" data-end="2629">Eventually, I realized something important: the problem wasn’t my parenting philosophy. It was my internal pressure—my expectations, my unresolved beliefs, and the quiet fear of being judged.</p><p data-start="2631" data-end="2727">Children aren’t meant to sit still for long hours. Restlessness isn’t misbehavior. It’s biology.</p><p data-start="2729" data-end="2844">What I was really struggling with was the belief that my child’s behavior was a reflection of my worth as a parent.</p><p data-start="2846" data-end="2900">What an unbearable burden to place on a five-year-old.</p><p data-start="2902" data-end="3006">There is no room for shame in parenting. And there is value in all forms of work—whether seen or unseen.</p><p data-start="3008" data-end="3038">We are enough simply by being.</p><p data-start="3040" data-end="3165">Once I let go of that pressure, things softened. Kyle still has outbursts—but they’re calmer now, and easier to move through.</p><p data-start="3167" data-end="3319">Parenting is a roller coaster. There will be more moments of weakness. But those moments, if we let them, can lead us toward growth—and toward strength.</p><p data-start="3321" data-end="3404">Here’s to our moments of weakness.<br data-start="3355" data-end="3358">May they help us find our moments of strength.</p><p>💙</p><p>If this resonated with you, feel free to share it with someone who might need it.</p><div class="soft-divider"> </div><p>Many of the lessons I learn through moments like this are what inspire the books I write — gentle tools to help children and adults navigate big emotions together.</p><p><a href="/learn-more#get-the-books">Get the books</a> · <a href="/blog">Read more blog posts</a></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 5, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kimtsbooks.pages.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://kimtsbooks.pages.dev/authors/kim-t-s/" rel="author">Kim T.
