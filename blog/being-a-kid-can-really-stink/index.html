Every time I asked him to come eat, he answered with a protesting grunt and hugged his furry dinosaur even tighter.</p><p><strong>“What’s wrong, Kyle? What happened?”</strong><br><em>grunt</em></p><p>I could hear him crying, so instead of pushing him to talk, I tried something that often works for us—distraction first, conversation later.</p><p>“Kyle, do you want to get some toys from the attic?<br>Do you want to hear a funny story?<br>May I order one hug, please?”</p><p>Nothing worked.</p><p>So I tried reading him a few lines from the next book I’m working on, <em>Feeling All My Anger</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Look for a hug, just hug someone — your mommy or your daddy<br>Your favorite toy, your favorite blankie — or maybe hug your nanny!</p><p>Imagine that the hug’s so strong, it drowns out all the flames<br>A hug that’s from someone you love, accepts and never blames…</p></blockquote><p>He grunted after every line, but I could feel his body slowly relaxing. I carried him in my arms and hugged him tight as I read. Almost there — but not quite.</p><p>“Kyle, what was that game you were asking me about earlier? The one you wanted me to check? Should we Google it together?”</p><p>“Sega Genesis,” he nodded, wiping the tears from his eyes.</p><p>We searched for it on my phone, and just like that, he started talking normally again.</p><p>“What happened, Kyle? Why were you upset?”</p><p>“I don’t know, Mom. I don’t remember.”</p><p>“That’s okay. Should we eat now?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>A few minutes later, he looked at me seriously.</p><p><strong>“Mom, I want to tell you something… but I’m scared.”</strong></p><p>“You never have to be scared of me, Kyle. You can tell me anything.”</p><p>“Okay. Let me tell you through a book.”</p><p>He walked over to his book cabinet and pulled out his favorite book at the moment — <em>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em>. He showed me the back cover and pointed to one line:</p><p><strong>“Being a kid can really stink.”</strong></p><p>Ohhhh.</p><p>“I understand,” I said. “It’s not nice to always be bossed around, huh? You didn’t want to eat yet, but we kept reminding you?”</p><p>He smiled and nodded.</p><p>“You know what’s really cool?” I told him. “Mommy and Daddy were kids once too. We know how it feels. And I love that you told me how you felt using a book.”</p><p>“Yeah, me too!”</p><p>“But you know what? It’s also pretty fun being a kid. Last Christmas, did Mommy and Daddy get any toys?”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“And how many toys did you get?”</p><p>“So many!”</p><p>“Well… you got toys when <em>you</em> were a kid,” he countered.</p><p>“That’s true,” I laughed. “That’s why being a kid is pretty great.”</p><p>He ran over to his dad and showed him the same line in the book.</p><p>His dad took a serious tone and started counting on his fingers:<br>“You have food, your own room, toys, video games — not all kids have those.”</p><p>Kyle immediately copied him and counted on his fingers too:<br>“Other kids have food, and rooms, and toys…”</p><p>“Not all kids,” his dad said. “Especially here.”</p><p>“I’m talking about the kids in America!”</p><p>“No, a lot of kids there don’t have those either.”</p><p>“Well… I’m talking about the billionaires.”</p><p>We all burst out laughing and finally enjoyed our lunch.</p><p>Later that day, Kyle announced,<br><strong>“I’m adding this to my worst days list.”</strong></p><p>“Huh? Why? I thought we had a good day after you calmed down.”</p><p>“Well… I guess it’s okay. So it’s an okay day.”</p><p>“Okay days are good,” I said.</p><p><strong>Wishing everyone more okay days. 😊</strong></p><p><em><a href="https://kimtsbooks.com/learn-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sometimes kids don’t have the words yet — but stories can help them find them.</a></em></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 6, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kimtsbooks.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://kimtsbooks.com/authors/kim-t-s/" rel="author">Kim T.
