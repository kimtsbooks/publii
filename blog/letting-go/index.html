Not just toys — he gets sad when we throw out random stuff like old puzzle mats or even a plastic screw that once fell down the toilet. 😅 I think he’s attached to the memories.</p><p>So I validate the feelings, but I also gently remind him that it’s not healthy to get too attached to material things. People, relationships, and memories are what matter most.</p><p>Yesterday, I sorted through a lot of his old toys for donation and braced myself for big feelings. I prepared him ahead of time and explained my reasons:</p><ul><li>The attic needs to be cleared (because the ceiling might crash down… 😬)</li><li>He doesn’t play with these toys anymore</li><li>The kids who receive them will be so happy</li></ul><p>I told him I could easily give the toys away and he might not even notice — but I promised I wouldn’t do that. Instead, I wanted him to be part of the process. He could choose five toys he really wanted to keep, and we did that together.</p><p>Even after that, he still felt sad and kept whining about it — which, if I’m being honest, is very triggering for me. But I’m glad I paused and tried to see it from his perspective.</p><p><em>“It’s hard to let go of toys, huh? I understand. It’s hard for me too sometimes. But we can do hard things. Sometimes we need to do them even if we don’t want to. The families who receive these toys will be so happy and grateful. Thank you — I’m so proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself too.”</em></p><p>He let a few tears out… and then he was okay. ❤️</p><p>Have you had similar moments with your child? How did you handle them?</p><hr><p><em>If you’re navigating big feelings in your home too, you’re not alone.</em></p><p><em>We write books about big feelings and occasionally share small moments from our life here on the blog. My son is 7 now, and I always ask him if he’s okay with me sharing these stories. Thankfully, he always says yes. ☺️</em></p><p><em>If our stories resonate with you, we’re grateful you’re here.
