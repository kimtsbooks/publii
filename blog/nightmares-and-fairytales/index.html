Like many parents, my first instinct was to reassure him—to remind him that it wasn’t real, that he was safe, and that it was only a dream. But as the days passed and pieces of the dream slowly surfaced, I realized that what he needed most wasn’t for the fear to be dismissed, but for it to be gently understood.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://kimtsbooks.com/media/posts/16/How-I-Helped-My-Child-Make-His-Nightmare-Less-Scary.webp" alt="" width="1200" height="600"></figure><div class="soft-divider"> </div><p>One night, as I was tucking him in, he looked at me and asked,</p><p><em>“Do you remember the scary dream I had?”</em></p><p>“The one with the wizard?” I asked.</p><p>He nodded. “It was really scary…”</p><p>I gently asked, “Do you want to talk about it — and maybe try to make it a little less scary?”</p><p>His eyes lit up. “Okay! What if the wizard was like Magic Koopa from Mario?”</p><p>We laughed. We made the wizard dance. We made him silly. For a moment, the fear loosened its grip.</p><p>Then Kyle grew quiet again.</p><p>“There’s more I didn’t tell you, Mom… because it was too scary.”</p><p>He told me about an old man trapped inside a helmet. A duck. Pins and needles. And how the duck died.</p><p>I could hear how heavy this had been sitting in his little body.</p><p>“That is a very sad dream,” I said. “Do you want to try changing it — just a little — so it doesn’t feel so scary anymore?”</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>So together, we changed the story.</p><p>The wizard became a <strong>good wizard</strong>. The needles became <strong>magic needles that stopped the pain</strong>. The duck was old and tired, and ready to rest.</p><p>The duck’s family was waiting for him. The old man was sad — but he understood. And the duck died peacefully, surrounded by love.</p><p>When we finished, Kyle looked at me and said,</p><p><em>“That’s a nice story, Mom.”</em></p><p>“Do you feel better now?” I asked.</p><p>“Yes. Thanks, Mommy.”</p><p>We hugged for a long time. Just before drifting off to sleep, he lifted his head one last time.</p><p>“Mom… did you enjoy talking about my dream and making it nicer?”</p><p>“Yes,” I said. “Very much.”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>And then — finally — he fell asleep.</p><p>❤️</p><div class="soft-divider"> </div><p>Moments like this are why I write books about big feelings. Not to erase fear — but to help children feel safe enough to talk about it.</p><p>If this story resonated with you, you may find our books helpful as gentle tools for navigating fear, worry, and other big emotions together.</p><p><a href="/learn-more#get-the-books">Get the books</a> · <a href="/blog">Read more blog posts</a></p><p>❤️ If this helped you, feel free to share it with someone who might need it.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 5, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kimtsbooks.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://kimtsbooks.com/authors/kim-t-s/" rel="author">Kim T.
