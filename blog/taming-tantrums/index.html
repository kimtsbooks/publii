We had our fair share of moments we weren’t proud of. I’ll save those for another day.</p><p>For now, let’s focus on strength.</p><p>❤</p><p><strong>April 20, 2021</strong></p><p>I gave Kyle a heads-up that he only had a few minutes left on his iPad. When the timer rang, I took it and said,</p><p><em>“Time’s up.”</em></p><p>Usually, he relents. This time, he didn’t.</p><p>He started whining and shouting, “NO!” Then my phone rang. I answered it — and that pushed him over the edge.</p><p>He began hitting me softly. As I reached to put the iPad out of reach, he kicked me.</p><p>I looked him in the eye and said,</p><p><em>“Stop it.”</em></p><p>It worked — for about a second.</p><p>After I finished my call, I squatted down and tried to help him regulate.</p><p>“Do you need a hug?”</p><p>No.</p><p>“Water?”</p><p>No.</p><p>“Should you run to your bed to keep yourself from hitting, like you said you would last time?”</p><p>No.</p><p>“Take a deep breath?”</p><p>No.</p><p>“Think of something funny? Hug your monkey?”</p><p>No. No. No.</p><p>He looked me straight in the eye while hitting and kicking me, and I could feel myself nearing my own breaking point.</p><p>So I stopped.</p><p>I closed my eyes and took deep breaths. Then I said out loud:</p><p><em>“I am getting upset. But even if Kyle hits me, he doesn’t mean it. I know that he loves me. And I love him.”</em></p><p>Suddenly, he wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>He hugged me tightly. I felt his breathing slow.</p><p>Softly, he repeated my words back to me:</p><p><em>“Mommy loves me. And I love my mommy.”</em></p><p>I hugged him back — and I felt his anger melt away.</p><p>❤</p><p>“What should we do now, Mom?” he asked. “What do you feel like doing?”</p><p>“Should we read some books?”</p><p>“Okay!” he said. “I really wanted to read <em>Llama Llama</em> last night.”</p><p>We read together. Afterward, we talked about what had happened.</p><p>He chuckled and said,</p><p><em>“I got so angry, Mom.”</em></p><p>He apologized. He admitted he was wrong. He promised to try my strategy next time — because it really, really worked.</p><p>Spoiler alert:</p><p>It didn’t work the next time.</p><p>😆</p><p>But that’s life. We just keep trying.</p><p>💙</p><p>If this moment resonated with you, feel free to share it with someone who might need it.</p><div class="soft-divider"> </div><p>Many of the strategies we practice in moments like this are what inspire the books I write — gentle tools to help kids (and adults) navigate anger, frustration, and big emotions together.</p><p><a href="/learn-more" target="null">Explore the books</a></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 5, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kimtsbooks.pages.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://kimtsbooks.pages.dev/authors/kim-t-s/" rel="author">Kim T.
