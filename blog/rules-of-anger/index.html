Most people only show the best parts of their lives online — and here I was writing about some of Kyle’s most vulnerable moments.</p><p>I felt guilty, wondering if I was making him seem like a difficult or angry child. In truth, he is one of the sweetest boys I know — thoughtful, smart, funny, and kind. I shared our struggles not to label him, but in the hope that it might help other parents feel less alone.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://kimtsbooks.pages.dev/media/posts/14/KimTS-and-Kyle-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="819"></figure><p>As parents, we all have strong opinions about how children should be raised. It’s easy to judge through our own lens and forget that every child, family, and situation is different. I’m guilty of this too, and I’m learning to be more intentional.</p><p>I know that sharing pieces of our life opens us up to judgment. But I choose to keep sharing, because we grow when we learn from one another. What matters most isn’t what everyone else thinks — it’s what we believe, and how we show up for the people we love.</p><h2>Overcoming Anger</h2><p>I’ve shared many stories about Kyle’s anger because it’s been our biggest struggle — and the very reason I started writing books about big feelings. Emotions rise and fall, but I’m incredibly proud of how far we’ve come.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I asked Kyle to do something he didn’t want to do. I could feel the anger building. His dad chimed in — which I knew would only make things harder.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> “Take deep breaths. I know you’re upset, but don’t let anger control you.”</p><p><strong>Kyle:</strong> “I can’t! It’s too strong!”</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> “You’re stronger than your anger. You know what to do.”</p><p>Things were about to escalate when he suddenly said:</p><p><strong>“Mom! Help! Get me a pen and paper!”</strong></p><p>So I did.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://kimtsbooks.pages.dev/media/posts/14/Kyles-Rules-of-Anger-1.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"><figcaption><strong>Rules of My Anger (Kyle, age 6)</strong><br>1. If you try to make me calm down, my anger will stop me.<br>2. The longer we wait, the angrier I get.<br>3. I can’t write anymore.</figcaption></figure><h2>Finding His Own Way</h2><p>As he wrote, I watched the anger slowly fade. He filled three pages before finally calming down.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://kimtsbooks.pages.dev/media/posts/14/Kyles-Rules-of-Anger-2.jpg" alt="" width="726" height="1024"></figure><p><strong>What Helps When I’m Angry (written by Kyle)</strong><br>1. Dad’s voice sometimes makes me more angry.<br>2. When someone talks to me, I get more angry.<br>3. Be more gentle with me.<br>4. Blow on me like the Big Bad Wolf or Mr. Wolf.<br>5. Sing or play a song.<br>6. Punch beds.<br>7. Run crazy like Sonic.<br>8. Use pain — <strong>danger ✗ do not use</strong>.<br>9. Annoy me a bit — <strong>danger ✗ do not use</strong>.<br>10. Draw.<br>11. Rip paper.<br>12. Kiss me.<br>13. Making me calm down makes it harder for me to calm down.</p><p><em>Reading this felt like being handed a map into his inner world.</em></p><p>I felt such pride watching him put his feelings into words. He remembered the tools we’d talked about over the years — and even discovered new ones on his own.</p><p>It felt like a quiet reassurance: <em>You’re doing okay.</em></p><p>Gentle parenting isn’t perfect. I still talk too much. I still tell him to calm down when I shouldn’t. But moments like this remind me that the work matters.</p><p>I’ve kept those pages safe. Maybe I’ll laminate them and bring them out the next time emotions run high. We’ve gone two months without a major episode — not a guarantee, but a gift.</p><p>Thanks for being here and walking this journey with us.</p><hr><p><em>If stories like this resonate with you, you’re not alone.
