But after a short break, his energy dropped completely. When it was time for a math test, his head rested on the desk, and the numbers he wrote were barely legible. I reminded him—more than once—to sit properly and try again. I even tried motivating him with a small stuffed toy if he did well.</p><p data-start="962" data-end="1018">After answering one question, he refused to do the next.</p><p data-start="1020" data-end="1041">“It’s too hard, Mom!”</p><p data-start="1043" data-end="1176">“I know you can do it,” I said. “You’ve done this many times before and gotten the right answer. I think you just don’t want to try.”</p><p data-start="1178" data-end="1226">“No,” he insisted. “I don’t know it. It’s true!”</p><p data-start="1228" data-end="1320">He pouted his lips and squeezed his eyes shut, trying to force tears that wouldn’t come out.</p><p data-start="1322" data-end="1469">“You know, love,” I said gently, “it’s okay to cry if you really feel like crying. But if you’re forcing yourself to cry, that’s not good for you.”</p><p data-start="1471" data-end="1699">I was trying to make sure he didn’t miss any items on the test. He has a deal with his dad and really wants to “win” a PS4 by working hard in school. He <em data-start="1624" data-end="1630">does</em> know how to subtract—he just doesn’t like writing down the solution.</p><p data-start="1701" data-end="1891">I was juggling encouragement, dinner prep, and my own growing frustration. When my husband reached over to turn off the stove I had preheating—thinking I’d accidentally left it on—I snapped.</p><p data-start="1893" data-end="1940">That’s when Kyle looked at me and said quietly,</p><p data-start="1942" data-end="1990">“Mom… remember what you asked me earlier today?”</p><p data-start="1992" data-end="2124">I honestly couldn’t remember. He gave me a few cryptic clues that I couldn’t piece together. Finally, he typed this on the computer:</p><p data-start="2126" data-end="2223"><strong data-start="2126" data-end="2173">“Kyle, what makes you feel the most loved?”</strong><br data-start="2173" data-end="2176">Then he crossed out the words <em data-start="2206" data-end="2212">most</em> with an X.</p><p data-start="2225" data-end="2231">Oh. 🙊</p><p data-start="2233" data-end="2323">That morning, I had asked him that question because I wanted to talk about love languages.</p><p data-start="2325" data-end="2397">“Are you saying you don’t feel that Mommy loves you right now?” I asked.</p><p data-start="2399" data-end="2409">He nodded.</p><p data-start="2411" data-end="2505">I hugged him—feeling guilty, and at the same time recognizing a bit of emotional blackmail. 😅</p><p data-start="2507" data-end="2721">“You know,” I said, “love isn’t always something you <em data-start="2560" data-end="2566">feel</em> in the moment. If you’re doing something wrong—like not trying your best—I will push you to do better. Even if you don’t like me right then, that’s okay.”</p><p data-start="2723" data-end="2991">I continued, “What matters most to me is that you grow into the best person you can be. You told me you feel most loved when Mommy and Daddy tell you we love you, right? So even when it doesn’t <em data-start="2917" data-end="2923">feel</em> like it, I want you to believe what I say: Mommy always loves you.”</p><p data-start="2993" data-end="3035">“Okay, Mom,” he said. “I feel better now.”</p><p data-start="3037" data-end="3119">He stayed after class with his teacher to finish the test. Later, we talked again.</p><p data-start="3121" data-end="3378">“I’m sorry for getting angry,” I told him. “It’s not so important to me that you get all the answers right. What matters more is that you try your best. If you try and still get a lot wrong, that’s okay. I’ll help you fix it so you can do better next time.”</p><p data-start="3380" data-end="3430">I paused, then asked, “Were you trying your best?”</p><p data-start="3432" data-end="3466">“No, Mom. I was being a bit lazy.”</p><p data-start="3468" data-end="3540">“It’s good that you know,” I said. “Because knowing is half the battle.”</p><p data-start="3542" data-end="3573">“So what’s the rest?” he asked.</p><p data-start="3575" data-end="3587">“Fixing it.”</p><p data-start="3589" data-end="3638">He smiled. “So it’s K = Know, F = Fix. What’s C?”</p><p data-start="3640" data-end="3685">I thought for a moment. “How about… conquer?”</p><p data-start="3687" data-end="3721">His eyes lit up. “Okay! K… F… C!!”</p><p>🤣</p><div class="soft-divider"> </div><p data-start="3751" data-end="3953">Moments like this remind me that love doesn’t always look soft. Sometimes it looks like patience. Sometimes it looks like repair. And sometimes, it looks like pushing—<em data-start="3918" data-end="3953">and then coming back to reassure.</em></p><p data-start="3955" data-end="4140">That’s why I write books about big feelings. Not to erase frustration, fear, or resistance—but to help children feel safe enough to talk about them, and supported enough to keep trying.</p><p data-start="4142" data-end="4329">If this story resonated with you, you may find our books helpful as gentle tools for navigating fear, worry, frustration, and other big emotions—at home, in the classroom, or in practice.</p><p><a href="/learn-more#get-the-books">Get the books</a> · <a href="/blog">Read more blog posts</a></p><p data-start="4377" data-end="4453">💙 If this helped you, feel free to share it with someone who might need it.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 5, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kimtsbooks.pages.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://kimtsbooks.pages.dev/authors/kim-t-s/" rel="author">Kim T.
