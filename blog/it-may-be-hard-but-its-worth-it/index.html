They require children to slow down, break things apart, and explain their thinking step by step—something that can feel frustrating even for kids who already understand the concept.</p><p>When Kyle gets frustrated during class, it usually shows up as silliness, tantrums, or a complete refusal to work. Yesterday, he put his head down on the table and started grunting and growling.</p><p>After I calmed him down, the silliness continued. He wouldn’t answer the seatwork, and I could feel my own patience thinning.</p><p>Then I tried something different.</p><p>“Do you find it hard,” I asked, “or are you bored?”</p><p><em>“A little bit of both.”</em></p><p>Before school started again this week, we told him that if he did well in class and was well-behaved at home, he could earn a prize — but only if he worked hard for it.</p><p>His enthusiasm lasted about a week.</p><p>So I reminded him: “You remember how you said you wanted to work for a PS4 or PS5? Of course it’s going to be hard. If it were easy, the prize wouldn’t feel as special.</p><p>You have to study anyway — so it’s either you study hard and work toward the prize, or you study half-heartedly and don’t. You might as well work for it, right?”</p><p>Then I added,</p><p>“Do you know how hard it was for me to give birth to you? It was really hard — and very painful. But it was all worth it, because you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.”</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>We hugged.</p><p>And then he went back to his desk and finished his math work — calmly and diligently.</p><p>“I’m so proud of you, Kyle,” I said. “I knew you could do it if you just focused.”</p><p><em>“Yeah, Mom. I’m proud of me too.”</em></p><p>Aren’t kids amazing?</p><p>To all the moms and dads easing back into school routines — we can do this.</p><p>💙</p><div class="soft-divider"> </div><p>Moments like this remind me that helping kids through big feelings often means staying steady, even when things feel hard — for them and for us.</p><p>Our books are written to support these same moments: frustration, effort, encouragement, and emotional growth — using language kids can understand and return to when they need it.</p><p><a href="/learn-more#get-the-books">Get the books</a> · <a href="/blog">Read more blog posts</a></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 7, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kimtsbooks.pages.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://kimtsbooks.pages.dev/authors/kim-t-s/" rel="author">Kim T.
