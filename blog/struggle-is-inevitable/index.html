While it was exciting, I deeply missed being at home with my son. I started second-guessing myself and wondering if I had made the right decision.</p><p>Eventually, I found my rhythm again and settled into work. I wrote the words below in my journal a few months ago and completely forgot about them—until I reread them recently. They resonated with me, and I felt called to share them.</p><p>If you ever find yourself sitting with similar doubts, I hope this helps you through it.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://kimtsbooks.com/media/posts/12/believe-in-yourself.webp" alt="" width="1200" height="600"></figure><p><strong>Struggle is inevitable.</strong></p><p>When it shows up again, draw confidence from your past experiences. You have struggled before. You doubted yourself—yet you overcame those moments and came out stronger and wiser.</p><p>Maybe self-doubt is a feeling you’re meant to sit with for a while.</p><p>You can listen to it speak. Understand where it’s coming from. Then, gently and respectfully, disagree with it.</p><p>You may feel a lack of confidence—but you can choose to believe something else: that despite how it feels right now, you’ve already proven, time and again, that you’re capable of more than you give yourself credit for.</p><p>Maybe these low moments are necessary for growth. They encourage reflection and protect us from the bigger mistakes that can come from unchecked confidence.</p><p>Accept that this feeling will visit from time to time. Welcome it. Learn from it. And remember—it is temporary.</p><p>Find the lesson, so you can let it go.</p><p>You are not your worst enemy—you are your best challenger. You challenge yourself to keep growing, even when it’s hard. And look how far you’ve already come because of it.</p><p><strong>Believe in yourself.</strong></p><div class="soft-divider"> </div><p><em>These reflections often shape the stories I write for children, too.</em></p><p><em>If this resonates with you, <a href="mailto:kimtsbooks@gmail.com">you’re welcome to send me a note. </a>I’d truly love to hear your story.</em></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 7, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kimtsbooks.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://kimtsbooks.com/authors/kim-t-s/" rel="author">Kim T.
